## Mars Rover Resources

### Curiosity rover (Mars Science Lab)
* Interactive realistic Mars Curiosity rover driving
  * Just click on the screen under "Free Drive and Rover Replay" mode and it'll move!): https://eyes.nasa.gov/curiosity/
* General Curiosity rover resources:
  * Main MSL page: https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/
  * Explore with Curiosity in 3D (mostly images): https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/surface-experience/
  * 3D model (click on components for more information): https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/rover-3d/

### Perseverance rover (Mars 2020)
* General Perseverance rover resources:
  * Main Mars 2020 page: https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/
  * Explore with Perseverance in 3D (mostly images): https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/surface-experience/?drive=0&site=31
  * 3D model (click on components for more information): https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/

## Mars Rover Game(s)

### NASA games
* Downloadable + installable Mars rover driving game (with educational info)
  * https://mars.nasa.gov/gamee-rover/
* Online Mars rover driving game (play in browser window)
  * https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/explore-mars/en/

### Make your own rover game
* Instructions for creating a Mars rover game yourself! (will need to create a free Scratch account)
  * Scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu/
  * Instructions: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/make-a-moon-or-mars-rover-game/

## Python Programming Online

### More advanced stuff
* Mars Curiosity rover model (controllable ROS+Gazebo model)
  * Post about ROSject online: https://discourse.ros.org/t/the-nasa-curiosity-rover-rosject-is-now-open-source/7635
  * Direct link (will need to create a free account with TheConstructSim to fork and run project): https://rds.theconstructsim.com/tc_projects/use_project_share_link/ab7e9a02-8907-4208-996a-ba1f45c20db2
* Related YouTube tutorial on Mars Curiosity rover model in ROS+Gazebo
  * Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ROS/comments/lmnqh5/nasas_curiosity_rover_in_gazebo_simulation/
  * Direct link to video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq0DJSbwiZI

## Miscellaneous Intersting NASA Stuff
* All sorts of Solar System Tours (plus New Horizons/Pluto)!
  * Main page with all links (these can be played online or downloaded locally): https://eyes.nasa.gov/
* NASA Pi Day Challenges
  * This has a lot of worksheets and answer keys across a whole slew of missions: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/nasapidaychallenge
* Mars images (highly interactive with lots of images and data)
  * Note that this is pretty beefy, not a simple interface here (far more complicated than Google Earth): https://trek.nasa.gov/mars/

## Miscellaneous ROS stuff (not for the faint of heart!)
* ROS2 Tutorials (Rolling Ridley):
  * Main page: https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials.html
  * Turtlesim tutorial page: https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html
