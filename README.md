## Mars Rover Resources

### Interactive realistic Mars rover driving (Mars Science Lab)
* ***Interactive (WASD or mousepad) open-source rover driving***
  * Just click on the screen and use the WASD keys (or use your mouse on the control pad in the lower right) to control how it moves around!: https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/#!/home
* ***Interactive (waypoint) simulated rover driving***
  * Just click on the screen when in "Free Drive and Rover Replay" mode and it'll move to where you clicked!: https://eyes.nasa.gov/curiosity/

  * Scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu/
  * Instructions: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/make-a-moon-or-mars-rover-game/

## Python Programming (online)
* ***It is recommended that you open one of the Python interpreters in one browser window, and have one of the programming tutorials open in a separate browser window, side-by-side***
* You may want to also use https://pythontutor.com/python-debugger.html#mode=edit as well to get a better sense of what the code is doing one step at a time as it runs -- this sort of thing is very good for debugging code that isn't doing what you expected
* ***I can add instructions for installing Python (and other things) locally if folks want, but keeping things online is safer in a sense, for beginners, because it makes it more difficult to accidentally delete important files and such on your computer when you first start learning about file I/O...***

### Python interpreters online
* ***This is the _best_ online interpreter I've found so far, in terms of flexibility (but not ease of use, necessarily):*** https://www.python.org/shell/
  * Note that this uses PythonAnywhere...: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
  * ...and that it's running the "haggis" version with the libraries available as given here: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/batteries_included/
  * I call this the best online interpreter to use because, while it only gives a simple command-line interface (CLI) instead of a file editor-type interface, it has a bunch of libraries that you can load in (with the "import" or "from __ import __" commands) *and* it shows what happens right away as you type things, immediately
* ***This is the _easiest_ online interpreter I've found so far*** (it allows files to be both saved to and loaded from disk, multiple files open at once, has lots of settings, etc.): https://www.online-python.com/
* Alternate pretty-good online interpreter (does not require you to create a free account to use it, has *some* additional Python libraries available): https://trinket.io/python/
* Yet another online interpreter (will need to create a free account to use it): https://replit.com/languages/python3
* ***This is not a normal interpreter per se, but it can be used to visualize what your Python code is doing step-by-step and line-by-line:*** https://pythontutor.com/
  * Copy all your code into here and then click "Visualize Execution" for it to create the visuals for you: https://pythontutor.com/python-debugger.html#mode=edit

* ...There are also 'iPython notebooks' that some folks create and share online -- these range from very complex to very simple
  * Jupyter Notebook has a free online tool (Jupyter Lab) that allows ".ipynb" tutorials and such to be shared easily: https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb
  * Google Colab also has an online tool that runs ".ipynb" files as well: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YKHHLSlG-B9Ez2-zf-YFxXTVgfC_Aqtt
  * Some iPython notebooks for programming for kids are discussed in this forum here: https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/python-for-kids/6747

### General (free) Python programming stuff for kids
* PythonTurtle (inspired by Logo) (requires local install)
  * This is a self-contained tutorial that requires a local installation, but is pretty good: https://pythonturtle.org/
* Raspberry Pi Coding for Kids Tutorial Series
  * ***Note that you do not need to create a free account at Trinket.io to run things, and you can just use https://www.online-python.com/ instead***
  * "Introduction to Python"
    * Main page that gives an introduction/explanation for parents/adults: https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/coding-for-kids-art-games-animations-beginners-python-programming/
    * Tutorials page (does not require you create a free online account, but will allow you to save progress): https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/python-intro

### General (free) Python programming stuff for beginners (not necessarily for kids)
* ***Very basic step-by-step tutorial that includes a Python interpreter in the webpage itself(!!):*** https://learn-python.adamemery.dev/
* ***UC Libraries website, which has several tutorials that run within a Google Colab notebook online:*** https://guides.libraries.uc.edu/c.php?g=222622&p=1473174
  * As an example, click on "Introduction to Python Part - 1", and then (under "Path") click on "Introduction_to_Python_Part_1.ipynb" to run the notebook
* The main Python website gives a much larger list of tutorials (some of which I also link to in this document):
  * https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers
* Lots of videos and transcripts / instructions: https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial
* Online tutorials are straightforward (just click "Next Tutorial" after you try things, don't "Take the Test"): https://www.learnpython.org/
* Has free courses in Python, but requires you create a free user account: https://www.datacamp.com/learn/python
